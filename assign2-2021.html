<h2> COMPX301-21A &mdash; Assignment Two </h2>
<h3> LZ78 Compression</h3>
<b> Due:</b> Thursday, May 6th, 2021 &mdash; 11:00pm
<p>
<b>Description:</b>
Implement LZ78 compression and decompression. This assignment is to be
done in pairs (i.e. with a partner), and implemented in Java such that
your code compiles and runs on the Linux machines in the R Block labs.
</p>
<p>
<b>Specification:</b>
Implement the LZ78 compression and decompression routines according to
the following specifications:
<ul>
<li> An <b>A</b> solution will have two parts: an encoder, and a
decoder. A complete <b>A+</b> will have two additional parts, a
bit-packer, and a bit-unpacker; all separate programs that read
standard input and produce standard output.
<li> Your encoder takes its input as a stream of bytes from standard
input, and uses the LZ78 algorithm to output pairs, where each pair
consists of the number of the longest matching phrase and the value
of the first mismatched byte, one pair of space-separated integers
per line of output.
<li> Given the output of your encoder as input, the output of your
decoder should exactly match the input to the encoder (i.e. this is
the complement operation to your encoder).
<li> Given the output of your encoder as input, the output of the
bit-packer is a stream of bytes encoding the input in as few bits as
are needed (i.e. log p bits per phrase number when there are p
patterns in the dictionary).
<li> Given the output of your bit-packer as input, the output of your
bit-unpacker should exactly match the input to the bit-packer
(i.e. this is the complement operation to your bit-packer).
<li> The encoder must utilise a multiway trie (not hashing) for the dictionary.
<li> To assist in marking, the Java program classes must be called
LZencode, LZdecode, LZpack and LZunpack, respectively.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b> Approach:</b> I suggest you get your encoder to work first then
build your decoder and test them as a pair. Once this works, turn
your attention to building the packer and unpacker. A
mark of <b>A</b> is possible if just the encoder and decoder work, but a mark
of <b>A+</b> is only possible if all four programs are completed
and comply with all specifications.
</p>
<p>
<b> Hand in:</b> Submission is done electronically via moodle in the
same way as the previous assignment. That is, place into an otherwise
empty directory only your source code and an optional plain-text
README file. Name the directory ID1_ID2, where ID1 and ID2 are the
student ID numbers of the partnership. Create a single, compressed
archive (see the unix manual on "zip" or "tar") and have one member of the
partnership upload your solution via Moodle. The other partner should
check that the upload was successful. Marks are awarded based upon
conformance to the specification and quality of the code, including
format and documentation (i.e. it should look nice and be
understandable). Names and student ID numbers for both partners
should be in the header documentation of all files.
